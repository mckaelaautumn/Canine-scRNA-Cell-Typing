# Canine-scRNA-Cell-Typing
This project is analyzing single cell RNA sequencing results of canine osteosarcoma samples in comparison to healthy and tumor margin samples.
I am working to develop appropriate cell typing methods to be applied to other canine single cell projects due to the lack of cell atlas data for species other than human and mouse.
